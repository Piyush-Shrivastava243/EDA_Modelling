### Summary:
This case study focuses on analyzing a dataset containing vehicle advertisements to address three primary objectives: Price Prediction, User Segmentation, and Geographical Analysis of Demand and Supply. 

- **Price Prediction** involves developing a predictive model to estimate vehicle prices based on various features such as advertisement details, location, and membership levels. The tasks include data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to determine the most accurate model.

- **User Segmentation** aims to categorize users based on their advertisement behaviors and characteristics using clustering techniques like K-means. The study involves data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and cluster analysis to uncover distinct user segments and their potential business implications.

- **Geographical Analysis of Demand and Supply** examines the distribution of vehicle advertisements across different regions to identify patterns in demand and supply. The tasks include visualizing geographical trends, analyzing temporal variations, and modeling the demand and supply using regression techniques.

The case study requires a comprehensive analysis with well-documented code, reports, and visualizations that provide actionable insights into vehicle advertisements.
